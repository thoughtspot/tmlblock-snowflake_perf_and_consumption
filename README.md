# Snowflake Performance & Consumption Analytics TML Blocks

SpotApps are ThoughtSpotâ€™s out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

The Snowflake Performance and Consumption SpotApp mimics the Snowflake data model. When you deploy it, ThoughtSpot creates several Worksheets, Answers, and Liveboards, based on your Snowflake data in your cloud data warehouse.

Use the Snowflake Performance and Consumption SpotApp to manage Snowflake costs and investigate query performance. Track how and where your users consume credits, and triage and resolve any performance bottlenecks.

# Artifacts 

## Worksheets 
snowflake_tmlblocks_worksheets.zip
- Stage Analysis
- Database Storage History
- Database Storage Usage
- Warehouse Metering History
- Storage Usage

## Liveboards 
snowflake_tmlblocks_liveboards.zip
- Snowflake Query Volume: are queries TS Index queries, queued, using cloud services?
- Snowflake Query Performance: what is the latency of queries?
- Snowflake Query Credit Costs: identify potentially expensive queries?
- Snowflake Stages: meta data information for stages? I.e. owners, databases.
- Snowflake Database Storage: how is storage being consumed and estimated costs?
- Snowflake Warehouse Consumption: which warehouses are consuming credits?
- Snowflake Storage

# Installation Instructions 

## Snowflake Set Up Instructions 
By default, Snowflake.Account_Usage is limited to the role ACCOUNTADMIN
Grant permission for the following views to role defined in Embrace Connection
- DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY
- QUERY_HISTORY
- STAGES
- STORAGE_USAGE
- WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY

## Snowflake Grant Role Example 
Change <EXAMPLE_Role> to role of your choosing. 
### GRANT Usage to Embrace User

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT SELECT ON DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  

```

### GRANT SELECT ON QUERY_HISTORY IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE PMM_ROLE


GRANT SELECT ON STAGES IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT SELECT ON STORAGE_USAGE IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT SELECT ON WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>; 

### Replicate the QUERY_HISTORY to a local table for Performance


GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "SNOWFLAKE_USAGE_TS" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE_USAGE_TS"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO ROLE <EXAMPLE_Role>;  
GRANT SELECT ON QUERY_HISTORY IN SCHEMA "SNOWFLAKE_USAGE_TS"."ACCOUNT_USAGE" TO <EXAMPLE_Role>;  

## Copy the Database 

Change <database_name> and <schema_name>. to your choosing. 

DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY:

`create or replace view <database_name>.<schema_name>.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY as
select * from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY;`  

QUERY_HISTORY:

`create or replace view <database_name>.<schema_name>.QUERY_HISTORY as
select * from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY;`  

STAGES:

`create or replace view <database_name>.<schema_name>.STAGES  as
select * from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STAGES;`  

STORAGE_USAGE :

`create or replace view <database_name>.<schema_name>.STORAGE_USAGE as
select * from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STORAGE_USAGE;`. 

WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY:

`create or replace view <database_name>.<schema_name>.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY as
select * from SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY;`. 


## Connect Thoughtspot and Snowflake
Log into your ThoughtSpot instance and create an Embrace connection to each of the five following views: 
- DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY
- QUERY_HISTORY
- STAGES
- STORAGE_USAGE
- WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY

## Import TML Blocks 
1) Import the TML for the worksheets(snowflake_tmlblocks_worksheets) and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
2) Afterwards, import the TML for the liveboards(snowflake_tmlblocks_liveboards) and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.

# Query Performance Considerations 

## Option 1: Shared View 

The QUERY_HISTORY table is slow to query. This requires either an X-LARGE or XX-LARGE warehouse to ensure queries are returned in a search time.
In addition an override parameter must be included in the ThoughtSpot URL, where the following increases the timeout to 3 mins.<br>
`https://[thoughtspotIP]/?queryDeadlineMs=300000/#/`<br>
Recommend that this is a separate Embrace connection so this warehouse can be isolated.

## Option 2: Replicate Data to Local Snowflake Cluster
Create a Snowflake task to replicate this data to local storage. 

--Create Database and Schema--<br>
`CREATE DATABASE  "SNOWFLAKE_USAGE_TS";
CREATE SCHEMA "ACCOUNT_USAGE";`

--Create Task --<br>
`CREATE TASK UPDATE_QUERY_HISTORY<br>
  WAREHOUSE = PMM_WH
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 2 * * * UTC'
AS
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE "SNOWFLAKE_USAGE_TS"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."QUERY_HISTORY" AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."QUERY_HISTORY"
  );`
